# Cycling Log

For several years, I ran a Rails-based cycling log (Java-bade before that). We've all moved on to other things,
but like to occasionally check out old workouts. The archive is at http://vast-coast-8290.herokuapp.com

The archive uses Clojure, AngularJS and Mongo on Heroku. I couldn't find good templates for an app like this,
particularly ones that include unit and integration tests. I suspect this template will be out-of-date soon, though.
It use:
* Bootstrap
* Ring
* Hiccup
* Compojure
* clj-webdriver
